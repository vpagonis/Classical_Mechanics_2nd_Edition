**ABOUT THIS BOOK**

This textbook provides a unique, contemporary introduction to classical mechanics, with a focus on computational methods. In addition to providing clear and thorough coverage of key topics, this textbook includes integrated instructions and treatments of computation.

This newly updated and revised second edition includes two new appendices instructing the reader in both the Python and Mathematica languages. All worked example problems in the second edition contain both Python and Mathematica code. New end-of-chapter problems explore the application of computational methods to classical mechanics problems.

Full of pedagogy, it contains both analytical and computational example problems within the body of each chapter. The example problems teach readers both analytical methods and how to use computer algebra systems and computer programming to solve problems in classical mechanics. End-of-chapter problems allow students to hone their skills in problem solving with and without the use of a computer. The methods presented in this book can then be used by students when solving problems in other fields both within and outside of physics.

It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate students in physics, mathematics, and engineering studying classical mechanics.

**Key Features:**

* Gives readers the "big picture" of classical mechanics and the importance of computation in the solution of problems in physics

* Numerous example problems using both analytical and computational methods, as well as explanations as to how and why specific techniques were used

* Contains specific example codes to help students learn computational methods and write their own algorithms

**Online resources: Solutions Manual and GitHub website with Python and Mathematics codes**
* A solutions manual is available via the Routledge Instructor Hub.

* All example codes in the book are available via the Support Material tab, and at the book’s GitHub page: **https://github.com/vpagonis/Classical_Mechanics_2nd_Edition**

**_Christopher W. Kulp_** is the John P. Graham Teaching Professor of Physics at Lycoming College. He has been teaching undergraduate physics at all levels for 20 years. Dr. Kulp’s research focuses on modeling complex systems, time series analysis, and machine learning. He has published 30 peer-reviewed papers in international journals, many of which include student co-authors. He is also co-author with Vasilis Pagonis of the undergraduate textbook “Mathematical Methods using Python: Applications in Physics and Engineering” (CRC Press, 2024).

**_Vasilis Pagonis_** is Professor of Physics Emeritus at McDaniel College, Maryland, USA. His research area is applications of thermally and optically stimulated luminescence. He taught courses in mathematical physics, classical and quantum mechanics, analog and digital electronics and numerous general science courses. Dr. Pagonis’ resume lists more than 200 peer-reviewed publications in international journals. He is currently associate editor of the journal Radiation Measurements. He is co-author with Christopher Kulp of the undergraduate textbook “Mathematical Methods using Python: Applications in Physics and Engineering” (CRC Press, 2024). He has also co-authored four graduate-level textbooks in the field of luminescence dosimetry, and most recently published the book “Luminescence Signal analysis using Python” (Springer, 2022).


**TO OUR READERS**

We have kept the number of required external Python packages intentionally at a minimum, so that newcomers to Python can follow the codes easily.

All figures in this book were produced using the scripts in this repository, so that users know immediately what to expect when they run the scripts.

Experienced programmers will  find out that they can improve the codes given here, and it is of course possible to make the codes more compact 
and elegant. However, we chose to provide codes which are simple and clear, and which can be easily modified for the purposes of the reader, 
rather than attempting to create compact codes which may be difficult to follow and modify.

We hope you will find the scripts useful and that you will enjoy running and modifying the various files. If you find that some script is not clear or has inaccuracies, kindly let us know at **Kulp@lycoming.edu** or **vpagonis@mcdaniel.edu**

Enjoy!
